The following attributes are supported for the <release> element:

version         Required    Name of the version in which the changes occur. For each change, add a nested <action> element as described below.
date            Required    Date at which the version was released. You can use a free form comment such as "in SVN" for unreleased versions.
description     Optional    An optional description of the release. This is used in the overview table of releases. Note: In releases prior to 2.0-beta-2 this was called desc. It was changed to improve compatibility with the Maven 1 changes plugin.

The following attributes are supported for the <action> element:

dev             Required    Name of developer who committed the change. This must be the name of the developer as described in the developers section of the pom.xml file.
type            Required    Type of change. There are four valid values: add, fix, remove, update.
issue           Optional    Id of the issue related to this change. This is the id in your issue tracking system.
                            The Changes plugin will generate a URL out of this id. The URL is constructed using the value of the issueLinkTemplate parameter. See the changes-report mojo for more details.
due-to          Optional    Name of the person to be credited for this change. This can be used when a patch is submitted by a non-committer.
due-to-email    Optional    Email of the person to be credited for this change.

e.g.
      <release version="1.2.1" date="2009-05-11" description="Release fix">
